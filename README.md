# Data-Modeling-with-PostgreSQL
My data modeling project assisting a start up music company Sparkify in creating an easier way to gather and assess their data. I was presented with JSON metadata and was tasked to take the log and songs data and create a Data Base with the data and create ETL pipelines to make navigating the data and querying easier.
